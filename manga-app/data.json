I don't want to finish the story BECAUSE ITS THAT GOOD. I want to watch it every day for it would serve as my morning breakfast. You know, like Sazae-san or Doraemon that are running eternally, only if it were too \ud83e\udd79\u2665\ufe0f.......I don't want it to end. I'll miss it soo SO0o\u09e6 much. I might as well even cry. Because no other anime gave me as much pleasure and amusement, as this anime did [not even Gintama or some other anime, and by no means am I a newbie in the anime world] it's just my preference I'm speaking of, not to demote or belittle other people's own likes. I rewatch it every single day, I laugh, and laugh my heart out even though I know what is going to happen. Yet the happiness & enjoyment I get is almost close to how much I enjoyed it for the first time. I pity myself, for discovering a gem of this size and calibre as late as March this year. I knew of this before and had heard of it, but never once did I think I would find it to be so thrilling and satisfying upon watching it. It's a shame, you know; that every single has to come to an end one day but hey, at least I were born and alive in this generation and period. Albeit there are numerous regrets I bear within me in this shortlived life of mine, this is the one thing that I would never regret; coexisting as the same time as this masterpiece and having the privilege to witness a story and a romance of this magnitude\/size and scale. Thank You, A-1 Pictures. Thank You, Aka Akasaka, For delivering such a sublime and grand masterpiece of an anime to us. I'm sure you have no idea how much you are making me sad by ending this masterpiece, and I also do not think that you will read this comment of mine. Unless a miracle happens. But perchance if you ever do [and I hope you do], just know that you made my life better. I used to be always depressed and sad about the sufferings that I were enduring, and seldomly did I laugh. Because I did not know how to. But whenever I watched your work [Love Is War], it always livened me up. It never ceased to make me laugh. I've always felt that I were connected to the characters, not just a watcher. I felt really engrossed and immersed into it whenever I watch your work. It was a great experience. I'm so thankful to be born in the same era as this masterpiece. So if you ever feel lost and that you have been a failure in your life, always remember that you made my life better. You yourself crafted and produced one of the best masterpieces of all-time [It really is, from my POV], and that you made millions laugh and love your work. Everything about the story and everything was almost perfect, at least for me. 97\/100. I was very sad deep inside when I were informed of the news. I know that it does not have long. Even after knowing that, I still keep rewatching it, and keep having full bursts of laughter. It will always be my No.1. You have no idea how much I love it. Even when many people call it \"mid\" or \"trash\", I do not badmouth them. I do not disrespect their favorite shows, too. I hold it in. FMAB is the majority of the fans No.1 but it isn't mine. And the same goes for Gintama. I have watched both and I respect them. I do not like to deem anyone's work as \"trash\" [no matter how bad it may be, just because it may not come in terms with my taste does not mean that it deserves to be belittled by someone like me.]because I do not have the luxury to. But Love Is War, ever since from the very beginning, at the very inception, I fell in love with it. The first episode was a masterpiece [I mean, every one of them are]. I immediately added it to my favorites as soon as I finished the prologue episode. It was just fantastic. Loved the chemistry and the often blitzkrieg between the characters. It was just so fun to feast my eyes upon. And now that it is ending, I am just so heartbroken and disheartened. But Aka Akasaka, deep down, in my inner depths, there is also a faint sense of gratitude and indebtedness that I bear toward you and will always continue to bore for as long as I shall live. \uff34\uff28\uff21\uff2e\uff2b\uff39\uff2f\uff35.","date":"2022-07-15T07:57:00+00:00","user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/SH_Shrabon","username":"SH_Shrabon"}},{"mal_id":"30-339","entry":[{"mal_id":30,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/30\/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1314\/108941.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1314\/108941t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1314\/108941l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1314\/108941.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1314\/108941t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1314\/108941l.webp"}},"title":"Neon Genesis Evangelion"},{"mal_id":339,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/339\/Serial_Experiments_Lain","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1718\/91550.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1718\/91550t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1718\/91550l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1718\/91550.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1718\/91550t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1718\/91550l.webp"}},"title":"Serial Experiments Lain"}],"content":"psychological thriller involving child abuse and emotionally unavailable kids","date":"2022-07-15T07:47:00+00:00","user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Loafia","username":"Loafia"}},{"mal_id":"3002-34933","entry":[{"mal_id":3002,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/3002\/Gyakkyou_Burai_Kaiji__Ultimate_Survivor","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/12\/80032.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/12\/80032t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/12\/80032l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/12\/80032.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/12\/80032t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/12\/80032l.webp"}},"title":"Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor"},{"mal_id":34933,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/34933\/Kakegurui","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/86578.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/86578t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/86578l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/86578.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/86578t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/86578l.webp"}},"title":"Kakegurui"}],"content":"They both talk about gambling.

The pilots and bridge personnel in each slowly figure out how to use their respective mechs more tactically while continuously running away and fighting a futile battle. Ideon focuses more on the effect that the relentless attacks of their alien assailants has on the crew. Meanwhile, Macross focuses more on how the aliens react and change after coming in contact with humans and their culture, especially music. So, for Macross watchers, give Ideon a look if you want something more pessimistic and grounded (Be sure to watch the movie sequel, Be Invoked, after finishing the TV anime). For Ideon watchers, if you wanted a more optimistic and lighthearted approach, go for Macross.","date":"2022-07-12T00:00:00+00:00","user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Fierce_Muffin","username":"Fierce_Muffin"}},{"mal_id":"9253-30015","entry":[{"mal_id":9253,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/9253\/Steins_Gate","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/73199.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/73199t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/73199l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/73199.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/73199t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/73199l.webp"}},"title":"Steins;Gate"},{"mal_id":30015,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/30015\/ReLIFE","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/82149.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/82149t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/82149l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/82149.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/82149t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/82149l.webp"}},"title":"ReLIFE"}],"content":"This is similar because in the show major things happends to the main character.

The big difference though is that the phenomena in Mushishi strike people at random whereas in Mononoke they rise from the psyche and actions of those affected, and the plot of each arc is a more structured investigation compared to the fanciful musings of Mushishi. A lot of recommendations call Mononoke the \"darker\" version of Mushishi, I disagree. If anything, the endless march of doomed, innocent people dying of bad luck throughout Mushishi struck me as quite a bit \"darker\" than the themes of karmic crime and punishment that predominate in Mononoke.","date":"2022-07-11T00:00:00+00:00","user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Terrible_Ivan","username":"Terrible_Ivan"}},{"mal_id":"11061-49052","entry":[{"mal_id":11061,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/11061\/Hunter_x_Hunter_2011","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1337\/99013.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1337\/99013t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1337\/99013l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1337\/99013.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1337\/99013t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1337\/99013l.webp"}},"title":"Hunter x Hunter (2011)"},{"mal_id":49052,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/49052\/Ao_Ashi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1731\/120871.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1731\/120871t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1731\/120871l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1731\/120871.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1731\/120871t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1731\/120871l.webp"}},"title":"Ao Ashi"}],"content":"Now this is quite a radical recommendation, but I can't help to think about HxH whenever I watch Ao Ashi.

As for the MC, I also found the parallel between Gon and Aoi family. Gon -> mother figure, real father Aoi -> real mother, father figure Both their mother kinda prevent them to take a new challenge at first, but at the end they eventually support them because it's their dream. The catalyst for their action also similar, Ging for Gon, and Fukuda for Aoi.

Differences: - Psycho-Pass is a futuristic dystopian society while DTB is a supernatural noir-ish society, and DTB's worldbuilding isn't as thorough as Psycho-Pass. - Psycho-Pass goes more in depth with its philosophical themes, while DTB feels more focused on fleshing out its huge cast - There is an antagonist with a strong ideology in Psycho-Pass who directly rivals Kogami, while DTB does not have a recurring antagonist (you could say the \"antagonist\" is all of the organizations combined). - Other than Kogami\/Hei and maybe Tsunemori\/Misaki (both diligent policewomen), the characters overall are not similar","date":"2022-07-11T00:00:00+00:00","user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/redalert30","username":"redalert30"}},{"mal_id":"37982-49470","entry":[{"mal_id":37982,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/37982\/Domestic_na_Kanojo","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1021\/95670.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1021\/95670t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1021\/95670l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1021\/95670.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1021\/95670t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1021\/95670l.webp"}},"title":"Domestic na Kanojo"},{"mal_id":49470,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/49470\/Mamahaha_no_Tsurego_ga_Motokano_datta","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1708\/123281.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1708\/123281t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1708\/123281l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1708\/123281.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1708\/123281t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1708\/123281l.webp"}},"title":"Mamahaha no Tsurego ga Motokano datta"}],"content":"Both about step-sibling romance.","date":"2022-07-11T00:00:00+00:00","user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/ForeverTraitor","username":"ForeverTraitor"}},{"mal_id":"31240-47162","entry":[{"mal_id":31240,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/31240\/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/79410.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/79410t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/79410l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/79410.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/79410t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/79410l.webp"}},"title":"Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu"},{"mal_id":47162,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/47162\/Shokei_Shoujo_no_Virgin_Road","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1423\/122029.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1423\/122029t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1423\/122029l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1423\/122029.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1423\/122029t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1423\/122029l.webp"}},"title":"Shokei Shoujo no Virgin Road"}],"content":"Both anime have a similar vibe.

Plus, the plots of the shows are similar as well (shoujo, magical girls, romance, love triangles).","date":"2022-07-10T00:00:00+00:00","user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/sweetpoffin","username":"sweetpoffin"}},{"mal_id":"232-2923","entry":[{"mal_id":232,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/232\/Cardcaptor_Sakura","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/8\/60781.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/8\/60781t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/8\/60781l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/8\/60781.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/8\/60781t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/8\/60781l.webp"}},"title":"Cardcaptor Sakura"},{"mal_id":2923,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/2923\/Shugo_Chara","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/7\/5061.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/7\/5061t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/7\/5061l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/7\/5061.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/7\/5061t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/7\/5061l.webp"}},"title":"Shugo Chara!"}],"content":"If you enjoyed Cardcaptor Sakura I think you would enjoy Shugo Chara! because they both are shoujo\/magical girl\/romance anime with love triangles, characters around 10-15 years old, and an emphasis on costumes and fashion.","date":"2022-07-10T00:00:00+00:00","user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/sweetpoffin","username":"sweetpoffin"}},{"mal_id":"41312-47163","entry":[{"mal_id":41312,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/41312\/Kami-tachi_ni_Hirowareta_Otoko","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1654\/108801.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1654\/108801t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1654\/108801l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1654\/108801.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1654\/108801t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1654\/108801l.webp"}},"title":"Kami-tachi ni Hirowareta Otoko"},{"mal_id":47163,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/47163\/Tensei_Kenja_no_Isekai_Life__Dai-2_no_Shokugyou_wo_Ete_Sekai_Saikyou_ni_Narimashita","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1436\/124788.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1436\/124788t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1436\/124788l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1436\/124788.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1436\/124788t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1436\/124788l.webp"}},"title":"Tensei Kenja no Isekai Life: Dai-2 no Shokugyou wo Ete, Sekai Saikyou ni Narimashita"}],"content":"Both shows are Isekai's where the MC is a tamer who has a lot of slimes at his side, helping him with a lot of different tasks.

In Sekai Saikou the MC is an expert assassin and in his new life, he gets the mission to assassinate the hero. In Isekai Yakkyoku, the MC is a doctor and an expert in the medical field, and he sets it upon himself to improve medicine in this fantasy world. Both shows give me similar vibes in how they introduce the characters, and how they react upon reaching the new world, living a life as the son of an aristocrat.","date":"2022-07-10T00:00:00+00:00","user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/SummerADDE","username":"SummerADDE"}}]}
